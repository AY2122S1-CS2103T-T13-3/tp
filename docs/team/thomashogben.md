### Project: AddressBook Level 3

Trace2Gather is a desktop address book application used for managing hotel guests and rooms. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## New Features:
1. `checkin` and `checkout`: Added the ability to check guests in and out of rooms.
    * **What it does**: allows the user to assign guests to a room and keep track of which rooms are occupied, as well as check them out when they leave the hotel.
    * **Justification**: This feature is indispensable for managing hotels. It's the whole point, innit? :P
    * **Highlights**: This enhancement required adding a fair bit of miscellaneous functionality to other classes that will be important for future additions to the project.
    * **Credits**: Original AB3 team, Darren for Room functionality
