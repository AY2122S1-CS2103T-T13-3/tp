### Project: Trace2Gather

Trace2Gather is a desktop address book application used for managing hotel guests and rooms. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Edited the ability to list guests and added the ability to list rooms.
    * What it does: Allows the user to list all guests and rooms
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a hotel receptionist needs to be able to see all guests and rooms to track their statuses.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `list room` and `list guests`
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added target user profile, value proposition and use cases.
