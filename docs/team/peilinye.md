# Project: Trace2Gather

Trace2Gather is a desktop address book application used for managing hotel guests and rooms. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## New Feature(s)
1. Linked Database's Room details to GUI, where Rooms are displayed on the GUI's list of rooms.
    * What it does: Allows users to visually see the rooms that were saved in the database and their last updated status.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because being able to visually check a room's status, such as its Occupancy Status, helps it's users to identify a room's status quickly and increases response time to the user requesting such information.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects user interaction with the application. It required an in-depth analysis and understanding of the GUI codebase and jackSon's syntax, such as @FXML tags having only small characters
    * Credit: jackSon documentation, stackOverflow
